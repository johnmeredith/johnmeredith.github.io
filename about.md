I am a Health Informatics professional with 11 years’ experience working in the NHS. During this time I have completed a Master’s Degree in Health Informatics, and continued professional development through IT Service Management (ITIL) qualifications. Presently I am studying for TOGAF certification.

My Master’s research provided an opportunity to publish a paper focussing on system usability and this research gave me a first-hand account of proving the benefits that correctly architected software can provide clinicians. I work with an anaesthetics informatics researchers affiliated with Cardiff University focussed on emerging technologies.

Specialist areas of knowledge include: health informatics, electronic medical records, theatre systems, EPR, Maternity information systems, data visualisation, business analysis and system architecture.
